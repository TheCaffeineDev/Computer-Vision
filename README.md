# Deep Computer-Vision

## Computer Vision With Deep Learning

A repository for my deep computer vision projects.

#### 1. Cell Nuclei Detection and Segmentation
* [Project Directory](https://github.com/TheCaffeineDev/Deep-Computer-Vision/tree/master/Nuclei%20Segmentation%20Detection)

Goal of this project was to create an algorithm to automate nucleus detection from biomedical images. By automating nucleus detection, we could help unlock cures fasterâ€”from rare disorders to the common cold.
