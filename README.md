## Computer Vision With Deep Learning

A repository for my deep computer vision projects.

#### 1. Cell Nuclei Detection and Segmentation

* [Project Directory](https://github.com/TheCaffeineDev/Deep-Computer-Vision/tree/master/Nuclei%20Segmentation%20Detection)

Goal of this project was to create an algorithm to automate nucleus detection from biomedical images. By automating nucleus detection, we could help unlock cures faster—from rare disorders to the common cold.

#### 2. Food-101

* [Project Directory](https://github.com/TheCaffeineDev/Deep-Computer-Vision/tree/master/Food-101)

[Food-101](https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_extra/food-101/) is a challenging vision problem, but everyone can relate to it. Food Classification with Deep Learning. The other goal was to use data augmentation and transfer learning and data augmentation to achieve fast(er) training time and accuracy.

Train a decent model >85% accuracy for top-1 for the test set, using a ResNet50 or smaller network with a reasonable set of augmentations.

#### 3. One Shot Learning

* [Project Directory](https://github.com/TheCaffeineDev/Deep-Computer-Vision/tree/master/One%20Shot%20Learning)

[Omniglot](https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot) the “transpose” of MNIST, with 1623 character classes, each with 20 examples. 
Use background set of 30 alphabets for training and evaluate on set of 20 alphabets.

#### 4. Deep Learning For Image captioning

* [Project Directory](https://github.com/TheCaffeineDev/Deep-Computer-Vision/tree/master/Deep%20Learning%20For%20Image%20Captioning)

Build a model to generate captions from images. When given an image, the model is able to describe in English what is in the image. In order to achieve this, our model is comprised of an encoder which is a CNN and a decoder which is an RNN. The CNN encoder is given images for a classification task and its output is fed into the RNN decoder which outputs English sentences.
