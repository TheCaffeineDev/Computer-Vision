## Computer Vision With Deep Learning

A repository for my deep computer vision projects.

#### 1. Cell Nuclei Detection and Segmentation

* [Project Directory](https://github.com/TheCaffeineDev/Deep-Computer-Vision/tree/master/Nuclei%20Segmentation%20Detection)

Goal of this project was to create an algorithm to automate nucleus detection from biomedical images. By automating nucleus detection, we could help unlock cures fasterâ€”from rare disorders to the common cold.

#### 2. Deep Learning For Image captioning

* [Project Directory](https://github.com/TheCaffeineDev/Deep-Computer-Vision/tree/master/Deep%20Learning%20For%20Image%20Captioning)

Build a model to generate captions from images. When given an image, the model is able to describe in English what is in the image. In order to achieve this, our model is comprised of an encoder which is a CNN and a decoder which is an RNN. The CNN encoder is given images for a classification task and its output is fed into the RNN decoder which outputs English sentences.
