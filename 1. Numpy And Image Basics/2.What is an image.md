- How does a computer represent image data?

  - Let's imagine we have a simple  image of a handwritten number:

    - Each single digit can be represented as an array.
    - A dark pixel should can be represented as a value between 0 & 1.
    - Often the default images have values between 0 & 255.
    - The range 0 to 255 has to do with how computer store 8-bit numbers.
    - But you can always divide all the values by 255 to normalize to between 0 & 1.

  - Now that we've understood how grayscale images can be represented as arrays, what about color images?

    - Color images can be represented as a combination of Red, Green & Blue.
    - Additive color mixing allows us to represent a wide variety of colors by simply combining different amounts or R,G,B.
    - RGB allows to  produce  a range of colors.
    - Each color channel will have an intensity values.

  - The shape of the color array then has 3 dimensions.

    - Height
    - Weight
    - Color Channels

  - This means when you read in an image and check it's shape, it will look something like this.

    - (1280,720,3)
    - 1280 Pixel width
    - 720 Pixel height
    - 3 color channels

  - Computer won't know  a channel is "Red" it just knows that there are now 3 intensity channels.

  - The user needs to dictate which channel is for which color.

  - Each channel alone is essentially the same as a grayscale image.
