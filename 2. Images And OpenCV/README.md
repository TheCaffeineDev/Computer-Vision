### Image Basics With OpenCV

- How to use OpenCV library?
  - Specifically how to open images and draw on them.
- OpenCV(Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
- Created by Intel in 1999, it's written in C++. (I have used Python Bindings) 
- It contains many popular algorithms of computer vision, including object detection and tracking algorithms built-in.

##### Goals 

- Be able to open image files with OpenCV in both a notebook and a python script.

- Draw simple geometrics on images.

- Directly interact with an image through callbacks.
